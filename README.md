## Web Application to Emulate a Digital Parking Meter

###Recent Events:
- Recently made PUBLIC. This is to both help the developer network and provide insight for other new MEAN stack developers.

###Problem Statement:
Parking Spots poorly reflect the demand for them resulting in a bimodal distrubtion of available parking. Some lots/streets are very densely populated and some are extremely vacant. It would benefit everyone if the prices could vary, theoretically leaving 1 parking spot on every street and every lot. 

###Purpose: 
- **The real *purpose*, to build a solid MEAN stack application for which to reference for future apps and enhance the developers skills**
- Also to retrofit QR codes on Parking Meters for which Users can scan and pay for the meter.

###Rough Requirements(TO BE UPDATED):
- Push updates to Users when Meter is running out
- Inquire on Status of Meter (Both for Users and Enforcers)
- Generate Reports on Sales

###Goals:
- *MongoDB* Schema Builds / DBA / 
- *Express* / *Node.js* route handling
- *Angular* Views for Users / Admins / Meter Officers
- *Ionic* (Export *iOS* / *Android* Application)

###Running Instructions:
 // TODO
